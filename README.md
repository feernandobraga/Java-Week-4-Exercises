# Java-Week-4-Exercises
Week 4 - More Java Exercises (arrays & bubble sort)

- Exercise 1 
    * Write a Java program that stores the names of your 10 favourite songs in an array of strings. 
    Also store the artist's name in a second array of strings. 
    Output a list of the songs and artists.
    
- Exercise 2
    * Write a program that will reverse the sequence of letters in each word of a paragraph of text of your choice. 
    For instance, "To be or not to be." would become "oT eb ro ton ot eb."
    
- Exercise 3
    * Modify the Exercise 1 question above to output the songs in alphabetical order.
    
- Exercise 4
    * Write a Java program that decodes a coded message. The coded messageis "G tgsl Qefe." 
    The key to the code is given by the following table:
         *  a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
         *  c r g z a v i b s d o e q f h u j x k l w m y n p t
    
      For example 'a' decodes to 'c', 'b' decodes to 'r' and so on. You should be able to easily modify your program to decode a different message.
      
- Boxes
     * Define a class called boxes. The purpose of this boxes class is to be able to output a square box of various sizes (up to a maximum of size 10). Use the '-' character to draw the top and bottom of the box; and use the lower case 'l' character to draw the sides. 
     Your boxes class must have the following:
        - a method that sets the size of the box,
        - a constructor that accepts the size of the box as a argument,
        - a method called toString() that returns the string value of size of the box,
        - and, a method to 'draw' (i.e. output) the box to the screen.
